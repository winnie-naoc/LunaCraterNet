# LunaCraterNet
We propose a novel method using the YOLOv5l deep learning model to detect small craters on the Moon's surface. By leveraging a high-quality, diverse dataset with data augmentation and optimization, we enhanced the model's detection performance. This document explains the procedures used in the detection process.
